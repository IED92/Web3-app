This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

### Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes included using useDapp, ethers.js, as well as Create Eth App. Working with Ethereum based tokens (ERC20), browser wallets and web3 and troubleshooting using these technologies. Used to learn smart contract methods and useDapp functions to display balance and enable transfers on Polygons Test network.

### Future Considerations

- Adding ability and UI to swap networks within web app.\
</br>
- Add more tokens (Just a matter of getting more standards of test tokens, researching more faucets)
</br>  
- Add more styling as well as better UI/UX.
</br>
- Refactor and clean up code

### Prerequisites

- yarn
  ```sh
  npm install yarn@latest -g
  ```
- A browser wallet
Metamask was the one used in development.

The default template is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces makes it possible to setup multiple packages in such a way that we only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in
a single pass. Dependencies are hoisted at the root.

Owing to this dependency on Yarn Workspaces, Create Eth App can't be used with npm.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IED92/Web3-app.git
   ```

2. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start app in development mode.
   ```sh
   yarn react-app:start
   ```
   Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
