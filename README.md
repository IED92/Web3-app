This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

### Prerequisites

- yarn
  ```sh
  npm install yarn@latest -g
  ```
- A browser wallet
Metamask was the one used in development.

The default template is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces makes it possible to setup multiple packages in such a way that we only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in
a single pass. Dependencies are hoisted at the root.

Owing to this dependency on Yarn Workspaces, Create Eth App can't be used with npm.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IED92/Web3-app.git
   ```

2. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start app in development mode.
   ```sh
   yarn react-app:start
   ```
   Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
